## Disclaimer

Like the actual [John O'Shea of former Manchester United glory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_O%27Shea#Manchester_United), this app does nothing. 

It is mainly to serve as a simple Hello World / Echo app as a sample, for [our infrastructure tool]() to deploy with.

> Note: none of us are Manchester United haters. I just happen to want to use a utility player's name for this app.

## But who is John O'Shea?

Exactly.

> Kidding.

### Setup & Dependencies

The steps in the [Dockerfile](Dockerfile) should provide a good idea how to run the app.

For dependency management, we use [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/lang/en/docs/cli/install/).
